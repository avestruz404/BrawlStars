# Welcome to My "Fan" Page on Brawl Stars!

Hello there! And welcome to my first website built using GitHub, the Jekyll theme, and Markdown. I'll be sharing about my favorite game (currently) on this page and maybe some random rants occasionally.


### Background History

Okay, so you might be wondering... how in the world did I get into this game, learn about it, and become so ~~um~~ entranced and fascinated by such a simple mobile game? xD 

Well, the answer is relatively simple. I've actually always known about Supercell games since I was a child and got my first tablet (an iPad mini) and on there, I would play ~~whatever games my brother played~~ simple games that appealed to a young child (I was about... hmmm I believe in 4th grade when I got my own device. Before that, I just played on my brother's iPad or played actual non-digital games. Imagine... haha that's virtually impossible in this day and age {haha, get that? *virtual* and *digital/online games* ... ha ha ha... sorry I like puns but I am very bad at making them, sooo moving on!}). I remember playing Hay Day back then (Supercell game) and Tree World™ (umm... how am I even supposed to properly credit Supercell and their game names and stuff that is copyrighted but I want to use??), and I think I played The Sims (gosh, is there another trademark symbol on this too??) too, and also LINE Rangers, and other games I forgot. I also remember (see? random rant again with these parenthetical interruptions) that my brother would play Clash of Clans and even made an acount
