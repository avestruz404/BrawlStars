# My History with Games - avestruz

Hello there! And welcome to my first website built using GitHub, the Jekyll theme, and Markdown. I'll be sharing about my past and current history with games, and then primarily about my favorite game (currently Brawl Stars) on this page and maybe some random rants occasionally.


### Background History 
##### aka my whole history about playing games (yes, it's basically all mobile games)

Okay, so you might be wondering... how in the world did I get into this game, learn about it, and become so ~~um~~ entranced and fascinated by such a simple mobile game? xD 

Well, the answer is relatively simple. I've actually always known about Supercell games since I was a child and got my first tablet (an iPad mini) and on there, I would play ~~whatever games my brother played~~ simple games that appealed to a young child (I was about... hmmm I believe in 4th grade when I got my own device. Before that, I just played on my brother's iPad or played actual non-digital games. Imagine... haha that's virtually impossible in this day and age {haha, get that? *virtual* and *digital/online games* ... ha ha ha... sorry I like puns but I am very bad at making them, sooo moving on!}). I remember playing Hay Day back then (Supercell game) and Tree World™ (umm... how am I even supposed to properly credit Supercell and their game names and stuff that is copyrighted but I want to use??), and I think I played The Sims (gosh, is there another trademark symbol on this too??) too, and also LINE Rangers, and other games I forgot. I also remember (see? random rant again with these parenthetical interruptions) that my brother would play Clash of Clans and even made an account on my iPad mini in addition to his main account on his own iPad (these were the days before Supercell ID was a thing). So when Clash Royale came out, my brother eventually downloaded it and played it for a while (and so did I, but I was never very good at it). Either way, I want to finish typing this paragraph soon (and finish up this topic) because not only am I spending too much time on something not completely Brawl Stars related (my assignment for AP CSP is supposed to have a clear topic), but this school WiFi is so slow that after I type something, I need to wait about 5-10 seconds for it to show up and then I need to fix my typos.

So, basically, what I was saying is that (OMG WTH it stopped lagging every time I type after I wrote that it was so laggy and so slow. whatttt?!) I've had a small history of playing Supercell games in the past, so I kind of knew about Brawl Stars when it came out because my classmates would play and talk about it (from what I overhear). But I didn't truly find out more about it until my friends started playing and that was around 2019. However, in March 2019, I got back into playing Clash Royale and made a new account with my current username/alias of avestruz (the 404 part is only for the instances when I need a unique username) and I was pretty into that game, not gonna lie. I would play it everyday for the entirety of my snack and lunch break, and I even tried convincing one of my friends to play (not the friends who played Brawl Stars). So, when I knew that some of my other friends played Brawl Stars, I didn't download it right away because I was afraid I would become mildly addicted to Brawl Stars just like I was with Clash Royale (*sigh* just when the WiFi was working fine, it's a bit slow right now). So, I never played Brawl Stars when my friends were into it, sadly. To this day in 2021, I still regret not downloading and playing it with them because as you may have pieced it together by now, dear reader, those friends stopped playing Brawl Stars by now :(. But first, back to when I *did* started playing it. So, as I wrote earlier, I was into Clash Royale, which meant I watched a lot of videos about it on YouTube (this began in about late March or early April 2020, the beginnings of quarantine due to COVID-19) and one youtuber I would watch in particular was this guy named OJ, who created content on and uploaded videos of both Clash Royale and Brawl Stars, but I only exclusively watched the Clash Royale videos because that was what I was interested in at the time. Shortly after {I should've made this website about my history with games and not Brawl Stars... hmm let me go change that real quick. hehe I just did}, I **finally decided** to-- download and try out Clash of Clans because I was bored at home and didn't care about school and academic work anymore (cue the meme: they had us in the first half ;))
